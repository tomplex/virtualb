Pass a command to the specified or currently active
environment. Equivalent to running `python <command>`

Usage:
    vb exec [-e/--env virtualenv] <command>


If a virtualenv is active and none is specified,
the currently active virtualenv will be used. A
specified environment will override the currently
active one.

Use proper quoting within the command you're passing
to the Python executable, but don't worry about wrapping
the command itself in quotes; i.e.

echo '{"hello":"world"}' | vb exec -e my_env -c "import sys, json; j = json.load(sys.stdin); print(j['hello'])"

Everything after the -e my_env will be passed to the Python
executable with quoting preserved.
